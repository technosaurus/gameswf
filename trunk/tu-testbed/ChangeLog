	LOD BIAS.
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Add -ml option to
	set the Texture LOD Bias. "-ml -1.0" works good for small fonts.

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Add -mi and -ma options to
	set the minimum and maximum LOD Bias. "-mi -2 -ma 2" seems to work
	good.

	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp (get_topmost_mouse_entity): Don't
	return a character unless the parent is visible.

	* gameswf/gameswf_textformat.cpp: Add setTextFormat as a variable
	when making a new TextFormat object.

	* gameswf/gameswf_movie.cpp: Use different headers on win32.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Use different headers on win32
	for tcp/ip networking. Also define MAXHOSTNAMELEN if if doesn't
	exist, don't use fcntl(), and use SHUT_BOTH for shutdown() on
	win32 as well.
	* configure.ac: Set HAVE_WINSOCK if the platform is win23.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* gameswf/Makefile: Add optional libxml support. Update
	dependencies to not have system paths.

	* gameswf_impl.cpp: Move the definition of bitmap_character to
	gameswf_impl.h.
	* gameswf_movie.cpp (loadclip): Various hacks trying to replace a
	character with a bitmap defined by a jpeg. None of these works
	yet...
	* gameswf_xml.h: Add conditional debug print statements as
	constructor/destructors so we can track memory allocation.
	* gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp (XMLSocket::anydata): Return the returned
	value.

	aren't used cause GCC 4.1 complains.

2005-04-14  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* base/utility.h: Tweak definitions of _max and _min to not
	produce errors with a more recent GCC because the "<?" operator
	has been depreciated.

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Add -d option to supply a
	different value for SDL_Delay() in the main loop.

	the pointer after calling xmlParseFile.

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Free xml doc pointer after parsing.
	
2005-04-02  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* configure.ac: Add --disable-xml option to not look for XML or
	use the XML and XMLSocket AS objects. The default is to support
	XML, since it's part of SWF v6.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Ad "-c" option to turn off
	SDL Parachutes, because sometimes we want the core file for
	debugging.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Remove object creation code for new
	AS objects.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (xml_new): Move code from
	gameswf_action.cpp to here so we create new objects correctly using

	specific. Instead use __FUNCTION__, which supported with VC++..

2005-04-01  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (key_event): Add trapping ENTER and
	ESCAPE too. These supposedly get turned on by an
	fscommand('trapallkeys', true) somehow.

	disk file that doesn't exist, or the path is wrong.

	all levels of the XML data.

2005-03-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Process XML messages one level

	actually works.

2005-03-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp (anydata): Read as much data as
	there is on the socket. Break up the data into seperate messages,
	and store them in a queue.
	(xmlsocket_event_ondata): Process all the messages in the message
	queue before reading more messages. Call onData callback on all
	messages without returning.

	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Add prototype for pthread entry
	point. (currently unused)
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Add pthread entry point that
	reads the socket. (currently unused)

	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Check for socket data every time
	through the advance loop. Don't use an interupt handler, it's
	orders of magnitude too slow.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Reduce by a huge amount the
	select timeout.


2005-03-24  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (extractNode): New method to recursively
	parse XML data. Make _nodes a pointer.

	G++.

	functions from do_something() so they have the local variables
	propogated into this call frame.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp: Propogate local variables into the
	child function's stack frame since it's supposed to inherit these
	values. There has got to be a better way to do this...
