	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (key_event): Add trapping ENTER and
	ESCAPE too. These supposedly get turned on by an
	fscommand('trapallkeys', true) somehow.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (xml_load): Don't try to open an XML
	disk file that doesn't exist, or the path is wrong.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Fix attribute parsing so it works for
	all levels of the XML data.

2005-03-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Process XML messages one level
	deeper. Properly setup stack so firstChild.firstChild.nodeValue
	actually works.

2005-03-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp (anydata): Read as much data as
	there is on the socket. Break up the data into seperate messages,
	and store them in a queue.
	(xmlsocket_event_ondata): Process all the messages in the message
	queue before reading more messages. Call onData callback on all
	messages without returning. 
	
2005-03-25  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/Makefile.in: Add optional pthreads support. (currently
	unused)
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Add prototype for pthread entry
	point. (currently unused)
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Add pthread entry point that
	reads the socket. (currently unused)

	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Check for socket data every time
	through the advance loop. Don't use an interupt handler, it's
	orders of magnitude too slow.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Reduce by a huge amount the
	select timeout.


2005-03-24  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (extractNode): New method to recursively
	parse XML data. Make _nodes a pointer.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Add a NULL when sending XML
	messages, and don't strip off the NULL when reading XML messages.
	* gameswf/gameswf_textfield.{cpp,h}: Remove as unnecessary.
	* gameswf/Makefile.in: Don't build gameswf_textfield, we don't
	need it.
	* gameswf/gameswf_textformat.cpp: Add minimal support for all
	forms of setTextFormat.

2005-03-23  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* configure.ac: Don't try to configure the empty testsuite
	directory.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	Rename TextFormat to text_format.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp (Timer::start): Don't cast the double
	to a time_t.
	* macros/libXML.m4: Define HAVE_LIBXML if libxml2 is found.
	* configure.ac: Add AM_CONFIG_HEADER. Don't both to link to my
	test XML file.
	* config.h.in: Add autoheader generated config file.
	* config.mk: Add DEFS to CFLAGS so HAVE_CONFIG_H gets passed to
	G++.
	* base/Makefile.in: Add dependencies.
	* aclocal.m4: Regenerated using aclocal
	* autogen.sh: Regenerate aclocal.m4, config.h.in, and configure
	without having to understand the GNU auto tools.
	* tu_opengl_includes.h: Don't redefine APIENTRY if it exists.
	* gameswf_action.cpp: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined. Only include gameswf_xml.h and gameswf_xmlsocket.h if
	HAVE_LIBXML is defined in config.h. Eliminate compiler
	warnings. Use HAVE_LIBXML instead of TU_CONFIG_LINK_TO_LIBXML.
	* gameswf_xml.cpp: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined. Don't use any of this code unless HAVE_LIBXML is defined
	in config.h. Add gameswf namespace. Use HAVE_LIBXML instead of
	TU_CONFIG_LINK_TO_LIBXML.
	* gameswf_xml.h: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined. Don't use any of this code unless HAVE_LIBXML is defined
	in config.h. Use HAVE_LIBXML instead of TU_CONFIG_LINK_TO_LIBXML.
	* gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined. Don't use any of this code unless HAVE_LIBXML is defined
	in config.h. Add gameswf namespace. Use HAVE_LIBXML instead of
	TU_CONFIG_LINK_TO_LIBXML. 
	* gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined. Don't use any of this code unless HAVE_LIBXML is defined
	in config.h. Use HAVE_LIBXML instead of TU_CONFIG_LINK_TO_LIBXML.
	
2005-03-19  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/Makefile.in: Update dependencies for new files.

	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Add a few debugging statements so we
	can track Text objects by their address. Add initial support for
	the TextField::_visible and TextField::_width properties. Add
	callback for XML::loaded().
	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Remove interval timer from array on a
	clearInterval() command. Use our own stack when calling AS
	functions from do_something() so they have the local variables
	propogated into this call frame.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp: Propogate local variables into the
	child function's stack frame since it's supposed to inherit these
	values. There has got to be a better way to do this...
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Don't pass additional arguments
	to onConnect().

2005-03-17  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/libXML.m4: New. Look for libxml2 directories.
	* base/container.{cpp,h}: memset buffer so tu_string prints better in
	GDB.

	COMPILER_ASSERT(0).
	* base/tu_timer.cpp: Add Linux imnplementations of get_profile_ticks()
	and profile_ticks_to_seconds().
	* configure.ac: Look for XML2 directories. Configure a Makefile in
	the testsuite directory.
