HEIGHTFIELD CHUNKER

* fix lerping bugs.  Morph verts should lerp towards the surface of
  the parent mesh (not necessarily the same as the height of the mesh
  without that single vert, since nearby verts may also be morphing).

* implement crack-filling

* support multiple input datasets at different resolutions

* localized, bottom up processing?

* more VM friendly; try a swizzled format?


CHUNKDEMO

* use NVFence etc

* try a vertex shader for lerping

* implement crack filling
