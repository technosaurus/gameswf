HEIGHTFIELD CHUNKER

* I think there's a lurking lerping bug; might be in chunkdemo

* implement crack-filling

* support multiple input datasets at different resolutions

* localized, bottom up processing?

* more VM friendly; try a swizzled format?


CHUNKDEMO

* implement crack filling

* download some bigger data, process it & see what happens

* try a vertex shader for lerping.  (NOTE: CPU morphing has *zero*
  impact on the performance of the demo on my laptop w/ 1GHz CPU and
  GeForce2Go, so the vertex shader may not be worth it for apps that
  aren't CPU limited.)  (Could possibly *hurt* performance?)
