Chunk LOD demo
24 July 2001

Unfinished demo of chunked LOD scheme.  Uses static meshes with
lerping and crack-filling meshes (not implemented) to give an
adjustable guaranteed max pixel error, no vertex popping (but it's
buggy right now) and hopefully low CPU overhead.

Please do not distribute!  It's not done yet.
