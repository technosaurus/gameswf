Chunk LOD demo

Unfinished demo of chunked LOD scheme.  Uses static meshes with
lerping and crack-filling meshes (not implemented) to give an
adjustable guaranteed max pixel error, no vertex popping and hopefully
low CPU overhead.

With vertex_array_range extension, the demo puts out between 5 and 7
million tris/sec on my laptop (1GHz CPU, GeForce2 Go video).  NVIDIA's
VAR demo does ~11 Mtris/s on this machine, so improvement is certainly
possible.  Still, that's pretty good for a morphing view-dependent LOD
scheme.

Please do not distribute!  It's not done yet.  I don't want this to
get widely distributed until I implement crack filling.
