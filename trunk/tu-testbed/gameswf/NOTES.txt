Free Fonts
==========

Type Oasis has some good free fonts; would need to investigate
legalities before putting them in a game:

I've been working on and off on Tuffy, a Public Domain font family,

ActionScript Notes
==================

* As far as I can determine, "goto N" means the play/move/remove tags
  have been executed as if we played them from frame 1 through frame
  N.  No actions or other things get executed.  So it's just a way of
  updating the display list according to the standard timeline.  But
  there is persistent state for objects currently on the display list
  -- if a object has been modified via ActionScript (edit_text
  contents, or the matrix of a movie clip), and that object is not
  removed in any frame between the current frame and the target frame,
  then that object's state is unchanged when we goto N.

  Also, once an object's matrix is touched by ActionScript, it ignores
  subsequent move_object tags from the timeline.


* ActionScript identifiers are NOT CASE SENSITIVE???

* null and undefined are distinct???  Flash help says null is for
  missing parameters or return values, while undefined is for things
  that haven't been assigned yet.
