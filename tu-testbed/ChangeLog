	as we do not require them more.
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl: commented fscommand messages because they stir to debugging
	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Macromedia Flash does not call remove display object tag
	for 1-st frame therefore we should do it for it

2007-02-15  Vitaly Alexeev <tishka92@yahoo.com>

	* gameswf/gameswf_impl(h, cpp): 
	* gameswf/gameswf_dlist.cpp: fixed the incorrect sequence of

	to execute a code in the environment of the parent
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp: added warning about version 7 & above
	* gameswf/gameswf_dlist(h,cpp): keypress event is activated/deactivated when 
	character is added/removed from dlist
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.h: operator= of action_buffer has been commented
	because	I need to assign same code to another events
	

2007-02-14  Vitaly Alexeev <tishka92@yahoo.com>

	* base/contatiner.h: fixed insert() method of tu_string.
	VC8 recognizes this situation and creates a correct code,

2005-06-06  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (runThread): New SDL_Thread to
	handle looking for network data, and if there is data, push an SDL
	User Event on the event queue.
	(main): Add new -e option to enable a threaded event based main
	loop or the existing polling one. Pass SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD to
	SDL_Init() on all platforms but win32.
	(runThread): Use the global variable to pass to select().
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.{h,cpp}: Add checkSockets(), which
	checks to see if there is data waiting in a socket. Add a temporay
	global variable to pass the file descriptor from ::connect() up to
	the main loop.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.{h,cpp} (memadjust): Adjust a byte count to
	be aligned on the proper boundary. (word size for now) Use only
	adjusted memory for all dynamic memory allocation sizes.
	* autogen.h: Remove bogus warning message and amke it say
	something intelligent.

2005-05-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Move the setting of the LOD
	BIAS up a few lines, as to be effective, it has to be executed
	before initializing the video mode for the I810. Otherwise it core
	dumps.

2005-05-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Initialize the LOD BIAS
	here, rather than in apply(). This gets rid of the global
	variable.
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Don't initialize the
	log_callback unless verbose is specified. This improves the
	performance when not using -v, since the display function returns
	immediately.

2005-05-25  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/png.m4, sdl.m4: tweak so help output lines up.
	* configure.ac: Add enable options for DOM or xmlReader parsers,
	with DOM being the default.
	* configure, config.h.in, aclocal.m4: Regenerated.

2005-05-23  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp(anydata): Use our own environment
	when calling sub functions, and then be like George Bush, and nuke
	the environment.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Enable the DOM parser by default, as
	the new xmlReader one has problems with gcc 3.x.

2005-05-21  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (load): Use xmlReader API instead of
	lower-level DOM API to save memory.

2005-05-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* Makefile.in, base/Makefile.in, geometry/Makefile.in,
	gameswf/Makefile.in: Add a "mudflap" target that rebuilds
	everything with mudflap enabled. Mudflap is the new GCC memory
	checker like Purify. Slow but thorough...
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Use DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATION to
	optionally display memory allocation information. Set _name and
	_value to zero when instantiating. Explicitly delete _name and
	_value when destructing. Use char * rather than as_value or
	tu_string for an XMLNode name and value so we can track every
	byte better.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.h: Use char * rather than as_value or
	tu_string for an XMLNode name and value so we can track every byte
	better. Use DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATION to optionally display memory
	allocation information.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Don't pass an array to anydata()
	anymore. Delete messages in a batch so we can track memory
	allocation better.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Don't pass an array to anydata()
	anymore.
	* base/tu_config.h: Don't include dmalloc.h, it conflicts with the
	one included from glib.h, which we inherit via libxml2. Since
	glib.h and gameswf use the same constant for enabling this
	feature, we get this support by default.
	* base/utility.cpp (dump_memory_stats): Renable.
	
2005-05-19  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* base/utility.cpp: Use _win32 rather than 0 for #ifdef.
	* compatibility_include.h: Optionally include config.h.
	* base/tu_config.h: Don't include config.h here.

2005-05-16  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* base/utility.cpp (dump_memory_stats): Disable for now by exiting
	before right away..
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Add char ** parameter to anydata().
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Add char ** parameter to
	anydata(). Call malloc_trim() to release memory back to the
	system so we don't eat up all the memory. 
	(anydata) Use char * rather than tu_strings for the buffering so
	we can track every byte. Parse looking for the newline delimiter
	between messages. Setup single messages faster than processing
	multiple messages.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Delete name and value too. Use char *
	rather than tu_strings for the attribute name and value.
	
	* base/utility.{cpp,h}: Add dump_memory_stats() to dump the
	internal statistics from malloc so we can track memory allocations
	in great detail.

2005-05-14  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Print the address of the object for
	get_variable and get_member so we can trace through the object
	dependancies.
	* geometry/Makefile.in: Add -I.. to INCLUDES so config.h can be
	found.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Call xmlCleanupParser() after freeing
	the Doc pointer.
	* base/{container.h, image.cpp, ogl.cpp, tu_file.cpp}: Add support
	for optionally using dmalloc for debugging memory problems.
	* gameswf/{gameswf_action.cpp, gameswf_font.cpp,
	gameswf_fontlib.cpp, gameswf_impl.cpp, gameswf_movie.cpp,
	gameswf_string.cpp, gameswf_xml.cpp, gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp}: Add
	support for optionally using dmalloc for debugging memory
	problems.
	* geometry/bsp.cpp:  Add support for optionally using dmalloc for
	debugging memory problems.
	* configure.ac: Add --enable-dmalloc option. Display all config
	options at the end.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.
	* gameswf/Makefile.in: Link in libdmallocxx if --enable-dmalloc is
	passed to configure.

2005-05-09  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf_xmlsocket.h: Pass an array to anydata instead of a
	string.
	* gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Pass an array to anydata instead of a
	string.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp, gameswf_timers.h,
	gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp, gameswf_xmlsocket.h, gameswf_movie.cpp:
	Use fn structure fields instead of a slew of local variables.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Delete all the attributes and child
	nodes too.
	
2005-05-09  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Use xml_new instead of
	xmlsocket_xml_new for new XML objects.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp, gameswf_timers.h,
	gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp, gameswf_xmlsocket.h, gameswf_movie.cpp:
	Extract args from fn structure. Call AS functions the new way with
	fn_call().

2005-05-08  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_movie.cpp (as_value): Cast wstr to be either 32
	or 16 bit based on the size of wchar_t.

2005-05-08  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_action.h: Cast the wide character to a uint32 so
	it'll compile.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (setupFrame): Don't set members for
	firstChild or childNodes, these are handled differently now. 
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.h: Add virtual overload of get_member() to
	the xml_as_object and xmlnode_as_object to return firstChild and
	childNodes without creating a circular dependancy.
	

2005-05-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp (gameswf): If _start is trashed for
	some reason, assuming it's expired and then reset it. This should
	eventually be fixed once I figure out what's causing the
	problem. It takes about an hour to occur.
	* base/tu_timer.cpp (get_profile_ticks): Don't need the tz
	variable, as it's not used with gettimeofday() on Linux anymore.
	

2005-05-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf_string.cpp (string_new): Don't recreate the String
	object.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp (execute): Clear the members of an
	object on the stack when the 'with' stack frame returns to a
	higher level.

2005-05-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_render_handler_ogl.cpp (render_handler): Check
	in patch #1195922, making the workaround for the i810 OpenGL
	problem configurable.
	* configure.ac: Add -enable-i810-lod-bias to make workaround
	optional. Add descriptive text to AC_DEFINE(HAVE_WINSOCK)
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

2005-05-04  Rob Savoye  <rob@blackpeter.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_render_handler_ogl.cpp (render_handler): Added
	and slightly changed patch #1194680. This code now only gets
	executed when using a non default value for the LOD BIAS.

	xml option differently.
	* aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

	utf8_to_upper(), utf8_to_lower().
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.h: Add operator!= to as_value.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp:  Add operator!= to as_value. Don't
	flag a "new String error", cause it's being used like this

	first.
	* gameswf/gameswf_string.h: Add support for fromCharCode,
	toUpperCase, toLowerCase.
	* gameswf/gameswf_string.cpp: Make string_new return a
	tu_string_as_object after attaching fromCharCode and charCodeAt
	members to it.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Add fromCharCode, toUpperCase,
	toLowerCase, to builtin string.
	* gameswf/gameswf_textformat.cpp: Initialize all data in

2005-04-06  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_movie.cpp: New data structure to hold MCL data
	for GetProgress().

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (setupStackFrames): Grab nodeValue for
	all elements if there is any.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp (MATH_WRAP_FUNC): Return an
	as_value.
	(call_method) Needs to check if the method is a NUMBER.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (extractNode): Add some filtering of
	bogus data content (just a CR) that seems to be creeping in from
	libxml. This gets rid of the extraneous "undefined" fields. Free
	the pointer after calling xmlParseFile.

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Free xml doc pointer after parsing.
	
2005-04-02  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* configure.ac: Add --disable-xml option to not look for XML or
	use the XML and XMLSocket AS objects. The default is to support
	XML, since it's part of SWF v6.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (main): Ad "-c" option to turn off
	SDL Parachutes, because sometimes we want the core file for
	debugging.
	* gameswf/gameswf_action.cpp: Remove object creation code for new
	AS objects.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (xml_new): Move code from
	gameswf_action.cpp to here so we create new objects correctly using
	constructors.
	* gameswf/gameswf_string.cpp (string_new): Move code from
	gameswf_action.cpp to here so we create new objects correctly using
	constructors.
	* gameswf/gameswf_movie.cpp (moviecliploader_new): Move code from
	gameswf_action.cpp to here so we create new objects correctly using
	constructors.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp (xmlsocket_new):  Move code from
	gameswf_action.cpp to here so we create new objects correctly using
	constructors.
	* gameswf/gameswf_*: Don't use __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, it's GCC
	specific. Instead use __FUNCTION__, which supported with VC++..

2005-04-01  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_test_ogl.cpp (key_event): Add trapping ENTER and
	ESCAPE too. These supposedly get turned on by an
	fscommand('trapallkeys', true) somehow.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (xml_load): Don't try to open an XML
	disk file that doesn't exist, or the path is wrong.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Fix attribute parsing so it works for
	all levels of the XML data.

2005-03-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp: Process XML messages one level
	deeper. Properly setup stack so firstChild.firstChild.nodeValue
	actually works.

2005-03-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp (anydata): Read as much data as
	there is on the socket. Break up the data into seperate messages,
	and store them in a queue.
	(xmlsocket_event_ondata): Process all the messages in the message
	queue before reading more messages. Call onData callback on all
	messages without returning.

	point. (currently unused)
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Add pthread entry point that
	reads the socket. (currently unused)

	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Check for socket data every time
	through the advance loop. Don't use an interupt handler, it's
	orders of magnitude too slow.
	* gameswf/gameswf_xmlsocket.cpp: Reduce by a huge amount the
	select timeout.


2005-03-24  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* gameswf/gameswf_xml.cpp (extractNode): New method to recursively
	parse XML data. Make _nodes a pointer.

	can track Text objects by their address. Add initial support for
	the TextField::_visible and TextField::_width properties. Add
	callback for XML::loaded().
	* gameswf/gameswf_impl.cpp: Remove interval timer from array on a
	clearInterval() command. Use our own stack when calling AS
	functions from do_something() so they have the local variables
	propogated into this call frame.
	* gameswf/gameswf_timers.cpp: Propogate local variables into the
	child function's stack frame since it's supposed to inherit these
	values. There has got to be a better way to do this...
