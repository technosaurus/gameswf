* "r" to restart a movie seems to hang the movie instead


General
=======

* text rendering is almost production-ready, so finishing touches here
  are a high priority.  In particular:

  * implement host-app driven text rendering functions

  * try it out; maybe add a little text output to chunklod or
    something

* sprites as button characters are not working.

* the half-implemented action stuff is an obstacle to progress; many
  of my test movies don't work because "goto frame" and/or some other
  actions are not working correctly.  Need to fix this.  Ideas:

  * disable all but the very simplest actions (i.e. up to SWF 4.0 or
    so), while working out the basics

  * make sure the frame semantics are correct.  I'm not 100% clear on
    the semantics of frame transitions.  I think that "being on frame
    N" means that N's tags and actions have been executed.  "goto N"
    is still unclear to me: does it mean that N's tags and actions
    should be executed, or do we start with N+1?  Does the display
    list need to be cleared, left as-is, or set to some pristine
    condition for frame N?  But the display list is built
    incrementally.  So this needs experimentation.  I haven't looked
    at flashsource's GPL code for this; maybe that will clear things
    up.

  * collect a canonical set of test movies and check them into CVS

  * generate or collect some game-gui-like movies

* host-app to gameswf communication

  * some mechanism for gamepad-like control of SWF UI's.  SWF is
    oriented around a mouse & keyboard model, which is not a good fit
    for consoles (and console-like) UI's.  Not sure exactly what to do
    about this.  One element would be associating SWF buttons with
    specific gamepad/keyboard buttons, which could be done by tagging
    the buttons in the SWF with special names, and adding an API for
    the host to report gamepad button presses.  Another element is
    dealing with dpad selections, where the user uses
    up/down/left/right buttons to highlight different options on the
    screen, and then another button to accept.  Not sure of the best
    way to shoehorn this into SWF.

    Current best idea: map gamepad buttons to keyboard keys, and use
    ActionScript to interpret keypresses.  Need enough ActionScript
    support so that this works.

* packaging

  * verify that library itself doesn't require SDL

  * libjpeg and libz dependencies are necessary, so leave as-is

  * Xbox port (important to me personally; maybe not a high priority
    for others)

  * pick a version number, post a release

  * Better control over log spew; make it a callback mechanism, and have
    options for how much to spew.

  * some method for reporting errors to the host app

* text entry?  No keyboard on consoles, text input is very platform
  specific; low priority for now.

* dynamic text fields -- necessary for most games, console or not.
  Given direct text-rendering calls, host app can hack in text entry,
  so don't prioritize this yet.

* named elements APIs, for easier UI programming in the host app

* ActionScript needs to basically work

* A mechanism to dump out cached tesselations to disk, similar to how
  we can dump out cached font renderings.

* Would be good if one of the log options produced a nice usable
  human-readable parsing of the file.


Renderer
========

* optimize tesselator (not super-high priority, caching works pretty
  well)

  * improve naive (mis)use of array<>; use a more statically-allocated
    array to hold intermediate results.

  * examine use of qsort; should probably use pointers to stuff in
    some situations, instead of raw copies

  * coarse clip/cull

  * better tesselation; look at Shewchuck's constrained delaunay stuff
    or the improved trapezoid tesselator that doesn't cut across the
    whole shape

* real lines (low priority)

  I think the way to handle this is to take advantage of a (mipmapped)
  circle texture, say 16x16, and actually draw rectangles.  But then
  it still doesn't seem too easy to get right.  Needs more thinking.
  Not a super high priority; doesn't seem to be a critical feature for
  most movies.
